# Projects Overview

In this project, I will develop several complex and widely-used frontend components, drawing inspiration from popular websites and applications. The aim is to replicate their functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring each component is robust, user-friendly, and scalable. These components include:

- **eBay's Dropdown Menu**: A dynamic dropdown menu that enhances navigation by providing users with a seamless and intuitive selection process.
- **Gmail's Auto-Validating Form**: A form validation system that automatically checks input fields in real-time, ensuring the correctness of data before submission.
- **Google's Autocomplete Search**: An intelligent search bar that suggests and autocompletes queries as the user types, improving search efficiency.
- **Twitter's Infinite Scrolling List**: An endlessly loading content feed, similar to Twitterâ€™s timeline, that loads more items as the user scrolls down.
- **Medium's Tooltips**: Contextual tooltips that appear on hover or click, providing users with additional information or tips to enhance user interaction.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to recreate advanced components seen on top platforms, applying modern frontend techniques to build interactive and functional user interfaces.
